		<p class="narr-text">Out of all recessions that occurred in the past 50 years, The Great Recession is the most recent and the largest since the Great Depression of the 1930s. In the 2000s, banks started to sell securities that were backed by people's home mortgages. More and more people were approved for mortgages, regardless of whether they could afford to pay or not, and the banks continued to package up these mortgages and sell them. Everyone was making money in the financial industry until, boom! The housing bubble burst and everyone, especially the average American, lost out. Financial institutions, like Lehman Brothers, started to fall. The U.S. lost over 7 and a half million jobs and American households lost about $16 trillion. Stacked to the sky, that's enough money to go to the moon and back over 4 times.</p>
