	<p>Contrary to soothsaying in the tech media, a fully cashless society isn’t as close to fruition as, say, a self-driving car. Unless you’re an American making more than $200,000 per year (and you’re probably not), then cash is your No. 1, go-to payment choice.</p>
 
	<p>Cash owes its reign to base-level accessibility, being available to nearly every American who wants it.</p>
 
 
	<p>Credit and debit cards remain widely used payment options, and, yes, there’s an increasing trend toward mobile payment platforms such as Venmo and Apple Pay, but each of these requires second steps: bank accounts, applications and/or access to technology.</p>
 
 
	<p>Ultimately physical cash, comprising trillions in bills and coins, is viewed by most Americans as accessible, safe and a smart payment choice when economic headwinds increase and cash becomes the crutch to maintain our financial footing.</p>
 
 
	<p>What we use to pay for things says a lot about us -- it speaks to our education level, our income level and our generationality -- and those are the drivers keeping the Washingtons, Lincolns, Benjamins, and in a few years the Tubmans, in our pockets for the foreseeable future.</p>
