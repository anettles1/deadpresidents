	<p>Contrary to soothsaying in the tech media, a fully cashless society isn't as close to fruition as, say, a self-driving car. Unless you're an American making more than $200,000 per year (and you're probably not), then cash is your No. 1, go-to payment choice.</p>
 
	<p>Cash owes its reign to base-level accessibility, being available to nearly every American who wants it.</p>
 
 
	<p>Credit and debit cards remain widely used payment options, and, yes, there's an increasing trend toward mobile payment platforms such as Venmo and Apple Pay, but each of these requires second steps: bank accounts, applications and/or access to technology.</p>
 
 
	<p>Ultimately physical cash, comprising trillions in bills and coins, is viewed by most Americans as accessible, safe and a smart payment choice when economic headwinds increase and cash becomes the crutch to maintain our financial footing.</p>
 
 
	<p>What we use to pay for things says a lot about us -- it speaks to our education level, our income level and our generationality -- and those are the drivers keeping the Washingtons, Lincolns, Benjamins, and in a few years the Tubmans, in our pockets for the foreseeable future.</p>

	<p>Historical lede - Great Depression</p>
	
	<p>Nut graf -- Why the lessons of the Depression still have a foothold in an era of mobile banking, ATMs, etc. When the economy sucks, people turn to cash for a variety of reasons, but mostly because seeing is believing. If you can hold it, you have it.</p>

	<p>Body 1 - The Great Recession as a current indicator. Make sure you point out that cash and credit are almost the inverse of each other. Money you have vs. money you might not. Cash in hand is worth more than credit in times of crisis. We take the lessons of Suze Orman to heart when recessions hit.</p>

	<p>Body 2 - The economic crisis of the early aughts is just another entry in the modern era of consumers showing their discomfort with the economic strength of the nation by holding onto their greenbacks. Evidence of This Throughout History -- short description/point to chart. What does the typical consumer feel during a recession? What is their typical behavior? Do they stop spending? Show that the consumers feel uneasy.</p>

	<p>Body 3 - Pscho-Social Analysis of WHY do they feel uneasy and feel the need to horde physical cash or use physical cash to a greater degree. Expert quote in here.</p>

	<p>Body 4 - Where are we now. Cash is again descending from its peak as the economy has improved. How eroded trust gets rebuilt.</p>

	<p>Conclusion - What does this all mean for the future of cash payments?</p>
