	<p>Contrary to soothsaying in the tech media, a fully cashless society isn't as close to fruition as, say, a self-driving car. Unless you're an American making more than $200,000 per year (and you're probably not), then cash is your No. 1, go-to payment choice.</p>
 
	<p>Cash owes its reign to base-level accessibility, being available to nearly every American who wants it.</p>
 
 
	<p>Credit and debit cards remain widely used payment options, and, yes, there's an increasing trend toward mobile payment platforms such as Venmo and Apple Pay, but each of these requires second steps: bank accounts, applications and/or access to technology.</p>
 
 
	<p>Ultimately physical cash, comprising trillions in bills and coins, is viewed by most Americans as accessible, safe and a smart payment choice when economic headwinds increase and cash becomes the crutch to maintain our financial footing.</p>
 
 
	<p>What we use to pay for things says a lot about us -- it speaks to our education level, our income level and our generationality -- and those are the drivers keeping the Washingtons, Lincolns, Benjamins, and in a few years the Tubmans, in our pockets for the foreseeable future.</p>

	<p>Since paper notes were first issued in 1690 in U.S., cash had made through many competitions with checks, credit cards, and debit cards, and now with the rise of mobile payments. While some are saying “long live paper money”, cash has not yet said goodbye. </p>
	<p>“We do expect cash to come under some additional competitions and that’s to be expected, but again we do expect cash to stick around for quite a long time. Clearly there are still needs for cash and it doesn’t show any signs of decreasing,” said Shaun O’Brien, senior analyst of Cash Product Office in Federal Reserve System. “ We don’t see the demise of cash people often see in the media.” </p>
	<p>Recent years’ cash in circulation growth, 4 to 5 percent,  is doubling the GDP growth, 1 to 2 percent, according to O’Brien, and institutions continuously invest in cash handling technology due to the high demand from customers. </p>
		<p>As in 2012 all American households are still using cash. It is utilized to pay for more than one third of the transactions on each income level, according to Federal Reserve System in its 2014 Diary of Consumer Payment Choice survey</p>
		<p>For most families, cash is still the king. Only households with a over $200,000 yearly income paying the largest portion of their monthly transactions with credit cards, 41 percent, more than the part paid by cash, 33 percent, while the rest of the American households use cash to make the majority of their transactions.</p>
		<p>The probability of cash usage and preference negatively correlated with income level. As households’ income level decreases, people are more likely to choose cash over other payment types. </p>
		<div class="charts"; id="eve-chart-1"></div>
		<p>When it comes to obtaining payment instruments, it is expensive to be poor. Cash therefore has a solid user base that other payments seem to be short of. Families who make less than $25,000 a year not only use cash more often, but also prefer cash over other payments the most. </p>
		<p>The cost of using each payment type here? Credit, debit, check, mobile, ...</p>
		<p>“Banking sector can be expensive once you started getting fees added onto your account,” said Shaun O’Brien, Senior Analyst at The Federal Reserve System’s Cash Product Office.. “It is much cheaper for these people to maybe go to a check cash store. They understand that they will pay a certain percentage of it, and that’s it. When they spend cash going forward, there are not going to be any additional fees.”</p>
		<p>…….in fact the number of low-income households is mostly likely to grow, and poverty rate is continuously going up. </p>
		</p>As shown in 2014 Income and Poverty in the United States by U.S. Census Bureau, median household income was $53,657, 6.5 percent lower than the median income in 2007 and 7.2 percent lower than median income in 1999 when the number hit the $57,843 peak. Poverty rate of 2014 was 2.3 percentage points higher than in 2007, the year before the most recent recession.</p>
		<P>Still need a quote here.</p>
		<div class="charts"; id="eve-chart-2"></div>
		<p>And the reality is in favor of the low-income households.</p>
		<p>DTE Energy Co., Detroit energy company, put in 30 kiosks in its payments center at the end of 2015, for those who are unbanked to pay bills in cash. In April this year, anti-poverty advocates in Minnesota urged lawmakers to boost funding of a monthly cash assistance program for low-income families for the first time in 30 years. During the same month, Internal Revenue Service announced individual taxpayers without a bank account or credit card can now make a payment with cash at over 7,000 7-Eleven stores nationwide. </p>

	<h2>It is easy to get and easy to use.</h2>
	
	<p>All of this sounds great for cash, right? That is until you talk to a few friends who quickly dismiss this notion. Nobody uses cash anymore, they argue.</p>	

	<p>Wrong.</p>

	<p>Believe it or not, everyone still makes about 22 transactions a month using cash spending about $21 per average cash transaction.</p>

	<p>We use cash far more than we think.</p>

<p>Lede - Ubiquity of cash, for sure, but it’s market share is being diluted by old standbys such as credit and debit and up-and-comers, such as NFC payments and in-app purchases.</p>

<p>Until some systemic issues are fixed -- which may never happen -- cash will remain a fixture, however diminishing, in American life.</p>

	<h2>People trust what they can touch.</h2>
	<p>Historical lede - Great Depression</p>
	
	<p>Why the lessons of the Depression still have a foothold in an era of mobile banking, ATMs, etc. When the economy sucks, people turn to cash for a variety of reasons, but mostly because seeing is believing. If you can hold it, you have it.</p>

	<p>The Great Recession as a current indicator. Make sure you point out that cash and credit are almost the inverse of each other. Money you have vs. money you might not. Cash in hand is worth more than credit in times of crisis. We take the lessons of Suze Orman to heart when recessions hit.</p>

	<p>The economic crisis of the early aughts is just another entry in the modern era of consumers showing their discomfort with the economic strength of the nation by holding onto their greenbacks.

	<p>Where are we now. Cash is again descending from its peak as the economy has improved. How eroded trust gets rebuilt.</p>

	<p>What does this all mean for the future of cash payments?</p>
